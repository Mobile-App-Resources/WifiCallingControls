WiFi Calling Controls
=================

An Android application for programmatically enabling/disabling T-Mobile's WiFi Calling feature.

Compatible with any Android automation tool that is compatible with Locale plugins. (Locale, Tasker, Llama, etc)

Currently tested and working on:
* HTC One (M7)
* Samsung Galaxy Light

It should be compatible with any phone that uses T-Mobile's Movial WiFi Calling app, or T-Mobile's Samsung WiFi Calling app (this covers most of T-Mobile's current phones).

Samsung phones require this app to be installed as a system app (in the /system/app directory). This is because the Samsung version of WiFi Calling has permissions restricted to Samsung apps and system apps. The only way I could find around this was to install the app as a system app, which unfortunately reqires root.
